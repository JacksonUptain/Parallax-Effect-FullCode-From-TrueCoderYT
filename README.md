#What is Parallax?
My definition:
  Parallax is taking a static image and making it dynamic through animation...Specifically in this instance...I am animating an image which is split into about 10 - 12 parts.

#How does it work?
After an image has been split up into 3 - 5 sections of your choice, you set them all on top of eachother, but in order... background to foreground.
After we add interactions to the web page, we can animate the certain parts of the page to give it 3D effect.

#Why use parallax instead of something that is actually 3D?
Well, you can take this code and make whatever website you want...Its just a cool effect that doesn't cause issues for your browser. (ie: 3d models etc)
#Is it Professional?
Not really...but it's so cool...that nobody cares
#How do I use this?
Just download the zip file or copy and paste the code from this repo, and enjoy.

Feel free to swap oit the images...but you will need to cnange there positions on the page using Css:(top, center, left, etc.)![EBF4784A-DE66-4044-9D90-FF6B7C78FACD](https://github.com/JacksonUptain/Parallax-Effect-FullCode-From-TrueCoderYT/assets/111402072/4ecddef8-0706-4951-a4e2-65789c582afe)
